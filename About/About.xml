[b]Ever try to go toe-to-toe with a scyther, only to end up going stub-to-stub?
Confused on why you have to replace an entire [i]arm[/i] just to solve the problem of a missing thumb?
Well boy howdy, I have the mod for you![/b]

Prosthetic fingers and toes, the solution to a few missing didgets. Now craftable at your nearest machining bench for only a mere 10 steel and 1 component!

[b]Patch Notes[/b]:

[b]Update 0-[/b]
  -Initial Release

[b]Update 1-[/b]
  -Fixed a problem where the mod would fart out errors on boot-up. Should not do that anymore.

[b]Update 2-[/b]
  -Bionic fingers!
    -[i]-Craftable for only 10 plasteel and 2 components + their prosthetic equivelant.[/i]
    -[i]-Only 110% efficent, this may be changed later.[/i]
  -Added colors to the hediffs, very pretty.
  -Bug-fixing!
    -[i]-Everything should be properly craftable now.[/i]
    -[i]-Changed base titles, this *should* mean the mod plays nicer with other mods now. Probably does nothing.[/i]

[b]Update 3-[/b]
  -Balancing!
    -[i]-Increased market value of bionic prosthetics.[/i]
    -[i]-Bionic fingers now have an efficiency of 100%, but give +0.4 manipulation. This means that a full hand should give about +20% manipulation.[/i]
    -[i]-Bionic toes now have an efficiency of 100%, but give +0.4 movement speed. This means that a full foot should give about +20% movement speed.[/i]
  -Misc Updates
    -[i]-About file now displays version number.

[b]Update 4-[/b]
    -[i]-Updated to B19![/i]

[b]Update 5-[/b]
