**Ever try to go toe-to-toe with a scyther, only to end up going stub-to-stub?
Confused on why you have to replace an entire *arm* just to solve the problem of a missing thumb?
Well boy howdy, I have the mod for you!**

Prosthetic fingers and toes, the solution to a few missing didgets. Now craftable at your nearest machining bench for only a mere 10 steel and 1 component!

**Patch Notes**:

**Update 0-**
  -Initial Release

**Update 1-**
  -Fixed a problem where the mod would fart out errors on boot-up. Should not do that anymore.

**Update 2-**
  -Bionic fingers!
    -*-Craftable for only 10 plasteel and 2 components + their prosthetic equivelant.*
    -*-Only 110% efficent, this may be changed later.*
  -Added colors to the hediffs, very pretty.
  -Bug-fixing!
    -*-Everything should be properly craftable now.*
    -*-Changed base titles, this *should* mean the mod plays nicer with other mods now. Probably does nothing.*

**Update 3-**
  -Balancing!
    -*-Increased market value of bionic prosthetics.*
    -*-Bionic fingers now have an efficiency of 100%, but give +0.4 manipulation. This means that a full hand should give about +20% manipulation.*
    -*-Bionic toes now have an efficiency of 100%, but give +0.4 movement speed. This means that a full foot should give about +20% movement speed.*
  -Misc Updates
    -*-About file now displays version number.*

**Update 4-**
    -*-Updated to B19!*

**Update 5-**
    -*-Finally updated to 1.0.*
